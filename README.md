# Calorie-Predictor
Team Members: Shahin, Bhavana, Lisa, Usman



## Things we've established
### Website


### Food Recognize Algorithm
- The deep learning model we used is InceptionV3 model
- Our webappwork is based on a GitHub repo of https://github.com/Yiming-Miao/Calorie-Predictor
- 

##Yoga image generation
-- based on DCGAN

## Video generation

### Dataset
We used Food 101 data set from kaggle 


## Product Mission
Use machine learning to recognize food images and calculate calories. Just uploadpicture ,and Dr fit predicts the food

## Target Users
Everyone who try to calculate how much they eat and how much to exercise

## User Stories
- I, the college student who try to keep on diet in order to lose weights, but I don't know the name of foods  so I need a tool to help me analyze my foodsand suggest finess solutions
- I, the professional bodybuilder, who try to keep very strict diet before my show, and I want to know exactly calories I intake everyday and kno
- I, the patient, who have health problem needed to avoid eating high calorie foods, need to know the energy of foods before taking them.

## MVP
- An user interface that allow users to input foods images and 
- Capability of reconizing foods
- Calculate calories based on calorie table
- Suggest how many minutes of exercise needs to be done
- Suggest Exercises /Yoga/ images generatedby AI
- suggest Dance workout generated by AI

### Pogramming Language
#### Deep Learning Algorthm
Python 
#### Web
Our web page is designed based on Flask(webframework , HTML (Materialize framework) and JavaScript.
