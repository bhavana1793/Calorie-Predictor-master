Team Members: Shahin, Bhavana, Lisa, Usman


## 1.Product Mission
Use machine learning to recognize food images and calculate calories. Just upload a picture ,and Dr fit predicts the food. Besides, Dr fit suggest exercises for burning these calories.

## 2.Target Users
Everyone who try to calculate how much they eat and how much to exercise

## 3.MVP
- An user interface that allow users to input foods images and 
- Capability of reconizing foods
- Calculate calories based on calorie table
- Suggest how many minutes of exercise needs to be done
- Suggest Exercises /Yoga/ images generated by AI
- suggest Dance workout generated by AI

## 4.Things we have established
### Website
- Our webappwork is based on a GitHub repo of https://github.com/Yiming-Miao/Calorie-Predictor

### Food Recognize Algorithm
- The deep learning model we used is InceptionV3 model

### Yoga image generation
- based on DCGAN

### Video generation
- using RNN
